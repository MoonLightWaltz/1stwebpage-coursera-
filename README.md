<h1> Overview </h1>
<br>
<p> This is my first stand alone web page without following any tutorials. I was given a photo of a sample page in Coursera to look at and then recreate. This is my first webpage with about a month and half of experiece of studying front-end. This is the start of my journey and this repo will serve as a reminder of my growth throughtout being a junior dev </p>
